A right fit solves 90% of the style problems:

You might have been amused by seeing a person looking so cool by just wearing a t-shirt and jeans and might have wondered “How the hell does he look so cool by just wearing a t-shirt and jeans?” the simple answer is “Fit”. Fit plays a vital role when it comes to great style. Because when clothes don’t fit properly, they show off your body proportions and make you look not only sloppy but also fatter and shorter than you are.

Stick to the solid neutral colors:

A wardrobe filled with solid neutral colors is the classiest wardrobe. These colors aren’t overpowering and they easily mix with each other. Neutral colors are white, black, navy, olive, grey, khaki, brown. The plus point about neutral colors is not only that they are self-working, but also give a masculine color palette. It makes you look grown-up and serious.

What you can do today:

We recommend a ratio of 3:1 when it comes to solid neutrals and non-solid neutrals. Look at your closet for 10 minutes and figure out which kind of outfits do you have more. Do you have more non-neutrals, graphics, and patterns than solid neutrals? If yes, make a note to start balancing out to the ratio of 3:1.
