Don’t be so brand conscious

Don’t be shy to put on not so popular brands, we advise not to completely ignore them. There are many brands which are doing well in a particular range of clothes like a shirt, jeans and a t-shirt, they fall under medium range. You need not buy everything under one roof, diversify your apparel brands based on brand specialization. This will save you money with the best quality available in the market after the premium range. Such brands can be used as daily wear official or casual wear. 

There is hardly any difference in the quality of tier-1 & tier 2 companies manufacturing clothes. The main difference which matters the most to customers is the logo of their favorite brand. Detaching yourself from the brand image can make you a smart buyer.
