Black is popular because of its flexibility, which means it can be used with practically any other hue. Some tones, however, appear to be more conventional in style than others.

To soften the contrast, add a touch of white to your black ensemble, such as a white blouse under a black suit. Other light tones, such as pink and baby blue, can also be used to complement black. Bold hues, such as red, on the other hand, provide a striking emphasis to it.
